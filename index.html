			<p>I already mentioned <a href="http://ranprieur.com">Ran Prieur</a> as one inspriation for this new site.  I like his writing style, his general philosophy, and I am intrigued by the fact that he writes his site's HTML by hand with no blogging tool or static-site generator.  I like the idea of writing my HTML by hand for two reasons.</p>
			<p>One is that I don't want to introduce unnecessary dependencies in my process.  I looked at Octopress and Jekyll and decided I didn't want to have to maintain a "build environment" just to put some words on a page on the internet.  I also considered hosted options like Blogger and Tumblr, but part of this is about staying independent.  This way my content stays mine and I don't have to export or migrate it to have a re-usable copy of it.  I can just copy these files to any web host and they will work.</p>
			<p>The second reason I'm writing my own HTML by hand is that I'm hoping to make sure my web skills stay sharp.  I am learning new things all the time about what HTML5 can do.  I have a goal of only including something on this site if I know exactly how it works.  No copying and pasting snippets of HTML or CSS, no Bootstrap or jQuery.  I want to know that I understand and can control each part of what I'm creating.  I figure that way the end product will be truly personal.  This is a personal site.</p>
			<p>Another aspect of this site is that I want to get better at writing personal posts.  I've gotten into a bad habit of doing a lot of link re-posting with practically no commentary.  I really enjoy the writing of bloggers who write posts when they have something to say, and aren't trying to bait traffic or be super popular.  Short, personal posts with a point are a thousand times better than air-headed posts that just re-share the day's most viral story without adding anything.  A few of the many other sites and writers that I'm taking inspiration from these days are:</p>

				<li>Warren Ellis' <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=15075">Orbital Operations</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I like each one for different reasons, but the general themes are minimalism, only including what is necessary, writing only when there's something to say rather than cranking out posts on an arbitrary schedule, and posting genuinely personal and original thoughts.  I may not cover all those right now, but that's the goal here.</p>

			<p>If it's slightly crazy to create a blog by editing HTML by hand, then it's at least twice as insane to edit the RSS feed for the blog by hand.  But I'm going to try anyway.  I can imagine having a little fun with the feed in ways that wouldn't be possible with a machine generated feed.  So, this site now has <a href="/rss.xml">an RSS feed</a> that may or may not have anything in common with the content you see on this page.</p>

			<p>The tools I'm using to build this site are about as simple as possible: ssh, vim, git.  I'm hosting on my Dreamhost shared hosting account currently, but I'm contemplating moving to a VPS or something at some point.</p>

			<p>Some time ago this site was compromised and then taken down.  Now I'm taking the opportunity to rebuild it and, inspired in part by <a href="http://ranprieur.com">Ran Prieur</a> and general <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=15111">"indieweb"</a> sentiment, I thought I would try writing HTML5 by hand instead of trying to make use of some fancy framework.  I'm re-learning my HTML basics from:</p>
